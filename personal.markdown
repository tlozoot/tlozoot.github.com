Luckily, I do some other things besides coding.

* ### Music
      
  I play guitar with friends around campus whenever possible. For better or worse, some of these performances have been recorded for posterity on my YouTube [channel](http://youtube.com/tlozoot) (you can [click](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=5E33FFF21141B15C) [around](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhmLhS9thE) from [there](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVPA4jLkj4w)).

* ### Skiing
      
  I've was a ski instructor at [Steamboat](http://steamboat.com) in &#8216;07-&#8216;08 and &#8216;09-&#8216;10. I taught adult, and kids, and adaptive lessons at all levels. In high school, I taught at [Bear Creek](http://bcmountainresort.com). I am [PSIA](http://www.thesnowpros.org/) Level-I certified.
  
* ### Journalism
      
  I was a photo editor for [_The Harvard Crimson_](http://thecrimson.com) my freshman and sophomore years; you can see my pictures online [here](http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1204736/Jonathan_P._Levine/). In high school, I was the editor of [The Emmaus High School Stinger](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Stinger/111914619992).
