I first became interested in the study of language through [historical linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics) and [phonology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology). Recently, I've been interested in using tools from computer science to solve open problems in linguistics. These are some of the projects I'm working on.

  ###[WugLearn](https://github.com/tlozoot/wuglearn)
  
  WugLearn is a morphology learner that uses [Optimality Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimality_theory). We have a positive correlation with human wug tests for English plurals. More info coming soon!

  ###[ExperiGEN](https://github.com/tlozoot/experigen)
  
  ExperiGEN is a framework for creating linguistics experiments. More info coming soon!

  ###Initial syllable faithfulness
  
  I collaborated with [Michael Becker](http://phonologist.org) (Harvard) and [Andrew Nevins](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychlangsci/staff/linguistics-staff/a_nevins) (UCL) on their research on _initial syllable faithfulness_, the idea  that the first syllables of words have a special "protected" status that limits how they alternate. English actually follows the opposite pattern (think of _knife/knives_ vs. _bailiff/baliffs_) and we're trying to figure out why that is.

  We paid a few hundred people to take our surveys via [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome), but you can take them for free [here](http://phonetics.fas.harvard.edu/agl). The old experiment code (in Rails) [is on GitHub](http://github.com/tlozoot/agl). We're in the process of making some new surveys with ExperiGEN.

  We gave a poster presentation on some of our findings at [NELS 41](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/nels41) at UPenn on Oct. 22. Our [poster](nels/poster.pdf) or our [handout](nels/handout.pdf) are both available online. A paper is in the works.
